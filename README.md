# Python Calculator

This is a simple GUI calculator app made with Python 3 and Tkinter.

## Features

- Perform basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
- Clear the input field with the C button
- Use the decimal point to enter fractional numbers

## Installation

To run this app, you need to have Python 3 installed on your system. You can download it from [here](https://www.studytonight.com/tkinter/calculator-application-using-tkinter).

You also need to have Tkinter, which is a standard Python interface to the Tk GUI toolkit. Tkinter is included with Python as a standard library, so you don't need to install it separately. However, if you are using a virtual environment, you may need to install it manually. You can do that by running this command in your terminal:

`pip install tkinter`

## Usage

To launch the app, navigate to the folder where you have saved the `calculator.py` file and run this command in your terminal:

`python calculator.py`

You will see a window with a calculator interface. You can use your mouse or keyboard to enter numbers and operators. Press the = button or the Enter key to see the result. Press the C button or the Backspace key to clear the input field.
